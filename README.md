## o2o-Layouts
Original layouts and artwork created for TrainPlayer.  
The layouts in this repo come in three different versions;  
TrainPlayer Layouts: These are unadorned layouts, just the art and track.  
QuickKeys Layouts: These layouts are set up to work with my QuickKeys suite of TrainPlayer subroutines, found in the QuickKeys-for-TrainPlayer repo. 
JMRI Layouts: These layputs are set up to work with QuickKeys and JMRI Operations Pro, the JMRI side files are in the JMRI-Layouts repo.  
All the artwork for the layouts is in the Layout Artwork folder, to avoid duplication.
